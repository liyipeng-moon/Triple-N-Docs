# Code

### Preprocess Code
code for spike sorting, preprocessing LFP and generate 'GoodUnit' fils can be found [here](...)

### Paper code
code for analyze and generate figures in the paper can be found [here](...)

### demo code
Several going-through demo for illustration of our data can be found [here](...)

 - demo1, generating single unit raster plot for several images
 - demo2, generating populational preference of interested ROI 

### Behavior Control
In our experiment, fixation control and image presentation run in parallel. This is difficult to achieve with the original MonkeyLogic adapters, so we made modifications to some of the adapters. You can find our modified adapter and code here: [PassiveViewing_in_ML](https://github.com/liyipeng-moon/PassiveViewing_in_ML)
